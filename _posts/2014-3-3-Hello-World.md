## Path–Goal Theory
Leaders consider employee, tasks, and environment characteristics to select suitable behaviours to guide followers to achieve their goals. There are four styles of leadership within this theory. Directive style is suitable for complex, ambiguous tasks, dogmatic, assertive followers with external locus of control (LOC). Leaders need to provide guidance, clarify rules and show followers how to perform the tasks. Supportive leadership is suitable for repetitive, unchallenging tasks. Followers have a strong need for affiliation. Leaders concern followers' well-being, provide nurturance to help them meet their needs. Participative style is suitable for weak formal authority, unstructured tasks, and high internal LOC followers. Leaders engage followers in decision making, asking them to raise their voices. Finally, Achievement-oriented is suitable for complex tasks, followers with high self-efficacy and are expected to perform well. Leaders need to set high standard, challenge followers and show followers the confidence leaders have in them to meet the expectations.

## Transformational Leadership
Transformational leadership is one of two styles under Leader–member exchange (LMX) theory. LMX views leadership under the interactions between leaders & followers. Hence, leadership is about the management of organisational in-group and out-group networks. Specifically, transformational leadership is for in-group networks with the focus on the development and connection between leaders and followers. Transformational leaders exemplify standards, provide coaching and mentoring and encourage, inspire and motivate their employees to grow, take ownership of tasks without micromanaging but rather based on trust.  The leaders align their followers for a common good with clear values and priorities.

## Servant Leadership
Servant leadership focuses on followers’ needs, putting your team before yourself. Servant leaders are someone who listens to their followers, has empathy for them, supports them physically and emotionally, considers how their behaviours might affect others, encourages and persuades others to take action rather than enforcing them. Moreover, servant leaders know how to set clear goals and objectives for the team, anticipate the future, be accountable, and commit to the growth of the people. In short, servant leaders try to understand followers’ perspectives, give them support, involve them in decision making and build a good community to gain trust, engagement, and stronger relationships.
